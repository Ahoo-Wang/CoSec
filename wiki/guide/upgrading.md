# Upgrading

What changes between versions and what to do about it. Release notes for every version are on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CoSec/releases).

## 6.1 to 7.0

### Breaking changes

**Root is off by default, limited to the platform tenant, and subject to the blacklist.** Before, any principal
whose id was `cosec` (or the `-Dcosec.root` system property) bypassed every check, including the blacklist, and
`cosec.authorization.root-enabled` defaulted to `true`. A user tenant whose identity provider let a user pick the
id `cosec` handed that user platform-wide access. Now:

- `cosec.authorization.root-enabled` defaults to `false`: no principal is root unless you enable it.
- When enabled, `RootPrincipalMatcher.DEFAULT` treats a principal as root only if its id is the root id **and** its
  tenant is the platform tenant (`(platform)`, `Tenant.PLATFORM_TENANT_ID`). The root id in a user tenant, in the
  default tenant, or on a principal without a tenant is an ordinary principal.
- The blacklist is checked before root, so a blacklisted request from root is denied. In an explanation the
  `BLACKLIST` layer now comes before `ROOT`, and `ExplainLayer` lists them in that order.

If you rely on root, set `cosec.authorization.root-enabled=true` and issue the root principal's token with
`tenantId` `(platform)`. Code that builds `SimpleAuthorization`, `AuthorizationExplainer` or `ShadowAuthorization`
directly keeps `RootPrincipalMatcher.DEFAULT` as its default, with the new tenant rule. If root must work some
other way, provide your own `RootPrincipalMatcher` bean.

## 6.0 to 6.1

### Breaking changes {#breaking-changes-1}

**Rate limits are rules, not policy conditions.** The `rateLimiter`, `groupedRateLimiter`, `redisRateLimiter` and
`redisGroupedRateLimiter` conditions are removed, together with `TooManyRequestsException`. A policy that still uses
one no longer parses. Local policy files that use them are skipped with an `ERROR` log, and policies stored in
Redis that use them fail their reads, which denies requests. Before upgrading, move each limit into a
[rate limit rule](./rate-limiting.md#rules) following the
[migration table](./rate-limiting.md#migrating-from-rate-limit-conditions). Three behaviors change with it:

- Only requests that authorization allows spend permits. Before, a limit in a policy condition also counted
  requests that another layer then denied.
- Each quota belongs to its rule `id`. Before, Redis limiters with identical settings shared one quota.
- Redis counters move from `<key-prefix>:<settings hash>:…` to `<key-prefix>:<id>:…`, so counters restart. During a
  rolling upgrade, old and new instances count separately.

**Responses can carry rate limit headers.** When a rule matches, responses include `RateLimit-Limit`,
`RateLimit-Remaining` and `RateLimit-Reset`, and `429` responses include `Retry-After`
([Responses](./rate-limiting.md#responses)).

**The `Authorization` bean is decorated.** With rate limiting enabled (`cosec.limiter.enabled`, default `true`)
the auto-configured bean is a `RateLimitingAuthorization` around `SimpleAuthorization`, and with
`micrometer-support` a `MeteredAuthorization` around that. Code that casts the bean to `SimpleAuthorization` must
inject it as `Authorization`, or unwrap `Delegated.delegate`.

**Decision types gained a field.** `AuthorizationDecision` and `SecurityDecision` have a new `rateLimit` property.
Kotlin code that destructures them or calls `copy` by position must be recompiled.

### New features

Everything below is additive. Features that change what a request experiences are off by default.

| Feature | Default | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Rate limit rules: per-IP, per-user or shared quotas, counted in Redis or in memory | on, once a rule file exists | [Rate Limiting](./rate-limiting.md) |
| Explain a decision, for a described principal or a real token or API key | off (`cosec.explain.enabled`) | [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#explain-a-decision) |
| Shadow mode: try candidate policies and app permissions on real traffic | off (`cosec.shadow.enabled`) | [Policies](./policies.md#trying-changes-in-shadow-mode) |
| `AuthorizationChecker`: check permissions in code, one action or many | always available | [Web Integration](./web-integration.md#checking-permissions-in-code) |
| Object-level rules with `resource.<name>` parts | opt in per policy | [Policies](./policies.md#object-level-rules) |
| `time` condition: validity periods and daily windows, self-expiring grants | opt in per policy | [Policies](./policies.md#time-conditions) |
| Policy history and rollback | off (`cosec.authorization.cache.history.enabled`) | [Policies](./policies.md#policy-history-and-rollback) |
| Declarative policy test cases (`PolicyTestKit`) | library | [Policies](./policies.md#policy-test-cases) |
| Access reviews (`AccessAnalyzer`): who can do what | library | [Operations](./operations.md#access-reviews) |
| API keys for machine clients, in memory or in Redis | off (`cosec.api-key.enabled`) | [Authentication](./authentication.md#api-keys) |
| `cosec.authorization` decision metrics | on with `micrometer-support` and a `MeterRegistry` | [Operations](./operations.md#observability) |

New properties: `cosec.limiter.locations`, `cosec.explain.enabled`, `cosec.shadow.*`, `cosec.metrics.enabled`,
`cosec.api-key.*` and `cosec.authorization.cache.history.*` (see [Configuration](./configuration.md)).

### Upgrade checklist

1. Search your policies, including those stored in Redis, for the four removed condition types, and write the
   equivalent rate limit rules under `classpath:cosec-rate-limit/`.
2. Replace any `TooManyRequestsException` thrown by custom matchers with a rate limit rule.
3. Check that clients and proxies tolerate the new rate limit headers.
4. Replace casts of the `Authorization` bean to `SimpleAuthorization`.
5. Upgrade, then confirm in the startup log that every rate limit rule file loaded. An unreadable rule file stops
   startup.
6. Optionally, add `PolicyTestKit` suites for the decisions you rely on before you change policies again.
